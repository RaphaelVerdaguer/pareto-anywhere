Pareto Anywhere
===============

__Pareto Anywhere__ is the open source middleware that enables context-aware physical spacesâ€”_anywhere._

![Overview of Pareto Anywhere](https://reelyactive.github.io/pareto-anywhere/images/overview.png)

__Pareto Anywhere__ provides a single standard stream of real-time data, in the form of developer-friendly JSON, regardless of the underlying devices & technologies.

__pareto-anywhere__ is a lightweight [Node.js package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pareto-anywhere) that can run on resource-constrained edge devices as well as on powerful cloud servers and anything in between (i.e. _Anywhere_).  The bundled web apps, APIs and integrations offer a friendly and comprehensive introduction to [context-aware physical spaces](https://www.reelyactive.com/context-aware-physical-spaces/).  And, thanks to a modular, open architecture, __pareto-anywhere__ can easily be customised for scale and/or functionality.

Quick start
-----------

Clone this repository and its submodules with the command `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/reelyactive/pareto-anywhere.git`, install package dependencies with `npm install`, and then from the root folder run at any time:

    npm start

_Alternatively_, install the __pareto-anywhere__ package globally with `npm install -g pareto-anywhere`, and then run at any time:

    pareto-anywhere

Either way, browse to [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to see __Pareto Anywhere__ running, and to explore the web apps and APIs.


What is Pareto Anywhere?
------------------------

__Pareto Anywhere__ is middleware that makes _any_ physical space context-aware for _any_ application by processing the real-time wireless ambient data stream collected from _any_ infrastructure.  This __pareto-anywhere__ package is a convenient, lightweight and novice-friendly configuration of __Pareto Anywhere__ which itself is highly modular and scalable.

__Pareto Anywhere__ is the collection of various open source software modules by [reelyActive](https://www.reelyactive.com) which are hosted in their own individual repositories, specifically:

| Software module                                           | Role |
|:----------------------------------------------------------|:-----|
| [barnowl](https://github.com/reelyactive/barnowl)         | Technology-agnostic middleware for RFID, RTLS and M2M |
| [barnacles](https://github.com/reelyactive/barnacles)     | Efficient data aggregator/distributor for RFID, RTLS and M2M |
| [barterer](https://github.com/reelyactive/barterer)       | Real-time location & sensor data API |
| [chickadee](https://github.com/reelyactive/chickadee)     | Contextual associations store and API |
| [chimps](https://github.com/reelyactive/chimps)           | Spatial dynamics processor |
| [advlib](https://github.com/reelyactive/advlib)           | Library for wireless advertising packet decoding |
| [sniffypedia](https://github.com/reelyactive/sniffypedia) | Index for implicit URI assocation |

The _experimental_ web app version of Pareto Anywhere which runs entirely in-browser is maintained in the gh-pages branch of this repository (see below).


Where's the ambient data?
-------------------------

This __pareto-anywhere__ package listens for data streams from the following sources:

- UDP [raddec](https://github.com/reelyactive/raddec) packets on port 50001 (ex: [from an Owl-in-One](https://reelyactive.github.io/diy/oio-config/))
- UDP [reel](https://www.reelyactive.com/technology/reel/) packets on port 50000
- UDP [Huawei](https://github.com/reelyactive/barnowl-huawei/) packets on port 50010
- HTTP POST to the /minew route (ex: [from a Minew G1](https://reelyactive.github.io/diy/minew-g1-config/)) _(G1 firmware v4.x required since Pareto Anywhere v1.7)_
- HTTP POST to the /impinj route
- WebSocket connection on the /aruba route (ex: [from an Aruba AP](https://reelyactive.github.io/diy/aruba-instant-config/))
- STOMP over WebSockets from a [RF Controls](https://github.com/reelyactive/barnowl-rfcontrols/) RFC OS instance running on the same machine (with default credentials)

If a local Bluetooth radio is available, [barnowl-hci](https://github.com/reelyactive/barnowl-hci/#pareto-anywhere-integration) can be installed and run with the command `npm run forwarder` to forward the data to Pareto Anywhere.

__Pareto Anywhere__ is [infrastructure-agnostic](https://www.reelyactive.com/pareto/anywhere/infrastructure/) and supports simultaneous data streams from a heterogeneous mix of sources.


Collect and analyse the data with the Elastic Stack
---------------------------------------------------

This __pareto-anywhere__ package writes its real-time stream of data to an Elasticsearch database, if installed and running, so that it may in turn be analysed in Kibana.
- __pareto-anywhere__ v1.8 and above expect an Elasticsearch 8.x instance, offering nominal backwards-compatiblility with 7.x
- __pareto-anywhere__ v1.7 and below require an Elasticsearch 7.x instance

If an Elasticsearch database is running locally at [http://localhost:9200](http://localhost:9200/), data storage should be automatic, with the data available for analysis at [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601/) if Kibana is also running locally.

To instead have __pareto-anywhere__ store data in a _remote_ Elasticsearch database, first set the environment variable ELASTICSEARCH_NODE to the corresponding URL, including the corresponding username and password, for example:

    https://username:password@server.com:9243

Elasticsearch and Kibana are _not_ required to enjoy the real-time functionality of Pareto Anywhere.  Instead, they add extensive, user-friendly data analysis functionality as described in our [Kibana tutorials](https://reelyactive.github.io/diy/kibana/).


Build and run with Docker
-------------------------

For users who prefer deployment using containers, first build the Docker image from the root folder of this repository:

    docker build -t pareto-anywhere:core .

Then start the container:


    docker run -d \
    -p 3001:3001/tcp \
    -p 50000:5000/udp \
    -p 50001:50001/udp \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    --name pareto-anywhere \
    pareto-anywhere:core

Browse to [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to see __Pareto Anywhere__ running and browse the APIs.


Run Pareto Anywhere, Elastisearch and Kibana with Docker-Compose
----------------------------------------------------------------

For users who prefer deployment using containers, Deploy Elasticsearch, Kibana and Pareto Anywhere from the root folder of this repository:

    docker-compose up -d

Browse to [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to see __Pareto Anywhere__ running and browse the APIs.
Browse to [localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601) to see __Kibana__ dashboard running.
Browse to [localhost:9200](http://localhost:9200) to see __Elasticsearch__ running and browse the APIs.


Developer Notes
---------------

The pareto-anywhere codebase includes [Pareto Apps](https://github.com/reelyactive/pareto-anywhere-apps) as a git submodule (in the web/apps folder).  To update to the latest Pareto Apps run:

    git submodule update --remote

If developing Pareto Apps from within this repository, changes can be pushed to the Pareto Apps origin (pareto-anywhere-develop branch) by the usual means, from the web/apps folder:

    cd web/apps
    git checkout pareto-anywhere-develop
    ...update files...
    git add [...]
    git commit -m "Description of update"
    git push origin pareto-anywhere-develop


Pareto Anywhere Web App
-----------------------

The _experimental_ Web Bluetooth Scanning feature, introduced to the Chrome browser in late 2019, enables an _experimental_ web app version of Pareto Anywhere hosted [here](https://reelyactive.github.io/pareto-anywhere/), with code in the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/reelyactive/pareto-anywhere/tree/gh-pages).


Project History
---------------

__Pareto Anywhere__ is in active development, evolving the [hlc-server](https://github.com/reelyactive/hlc-server/) code base (first created in 2014) which it is intended to supersede.  It is therefore normal for documentation to refer to hlc-server as a pseudonym of Pareto Anywhere.

__pareto-anywhere__ v1.5.0 adopts [chickadee](https://github.com/reelyactive/chickadee) v1.4.0 which migrates to [ESMapDB](https://github.com/reelyactive/esmapdb) from [NeDB](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb). If upgrading from a previous version, any stored associations will need to be recreated.
